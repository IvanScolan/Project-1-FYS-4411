Here is a brief description of each folder :

"Complete code for N particles and D dimension" is an explicit programm af a Monte-Carlos method for an hamornic trap without any interraction. This code is adapted
for N particles and D dimension

"CPU time analysis" is the code that we used for comparing the CPU time difference between a computattion of the local energy using 
a numeric approximation and an analytic expression.

"Fast code" does the same as "Complete code for N particles and D dimension" but it is vectorized.
