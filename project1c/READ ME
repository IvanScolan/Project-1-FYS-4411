Here is a brief description of each folder :

"study new method" is the exploration of a way to find the ideal alpha that I discribing in the report.

"Study time step" is the codes associated to my study of how the time step affects the importance sampling. The two code files in
this folder give us : -a graph of E-alpha for different values for the time step (code E_alpha for different time step)
                      -a graph of sum(E_L-Eexact)-time step
                      

"VMC_E" does the same as "fast code" in the project b but with importance sampling.
