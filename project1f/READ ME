Here is a brief description of this folder :

The code developped here contains a search for the optimal alpha using a gradient descent method. Than, it generates a big amount of energy value (not average), and it is
run in parallel using MPI. The problem contains no interraction part.
The data is then analysed in "visu.py" where we used the algorithm developped by Marius Jonsson.
